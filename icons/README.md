# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using any image editing software like:
- Figma
- Adobe Illustrator
- GIMP
- Canva

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Ensure good contrast and visibility at small sizes
- Consider using a magnifying glass or search icon to represent "tracing"
- Use the extension's color scheme (purple/blue gradient)

## Temporary Icons

For now, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel images as placeholders. The extension will work without proper icons, but they improve the user experience.
